# 📉 Intelligent Customer Churn Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
In the telecom industry, retaining customers is critical for profitability. This **Major Project** utilizes Machine Learning to predict customer attrition (churn) in real-time.

Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, this application analyzes customer demographics, billing data, and service usage to calculate a "Churn Probability Score." It also features an interactive **Business Intelligence Dashboard** to visualize key drivers of churn, helping management take proactive retention steps.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🔐 Secure Admin Portal:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to protect sensitive data.
* **🔮 AI Prediction Engine:** Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn risk with high accuracy.
* **📊 Interactive Analytics:** Dynamic charts (powered by Plotly) to visualize trends in customer behavior.
* **⚡ Real-time Scoring:** Instant "High Risk" vs. "Safe" classification for new customers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Web UI)
* **Backend:** Python 3.x
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express
